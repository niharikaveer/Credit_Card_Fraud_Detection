# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data and building a classification model, the system can differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The main goal is to enhance financial security by identifying potential fraud and minimizing the risk for financial institutions and their clients. This system will use machine learning algorithms, particularly Logistic Regression, to classify transactions and assess performance based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The project involves several steps, including:
1. **Loading and analyzing transaction data** to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Preparing the data** by cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a format suitable for machine learning models.
3. **Building and training a classification model** to predict whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.
4. **Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance** using evaluation metrics of accuracy.
5. **Deploying the model** for practical usage in fraud detection systems.

By successfully training this model, financial institutions can detect fraud more effectively and minimize financial losses.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - Pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
  - NumPy (Numerical operations)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)
  - Jupyter Notebook (For prototyping and exploratory data analysis)

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, and it is highly imbalanced with fewer fraudulent cases.

- **Dataset Features**: 
  - `Time`: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
  - `V1`, `V2`, ..., `V28`: These are the anonymized features representing various aspects of the transaction data.
  - `Amount`: The transaction amount for the transaction.
  - `Class`: The target variable where `1` represents a fraudulent transaction and `0` represents a legitimate transaction.

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle using the link provided above.
